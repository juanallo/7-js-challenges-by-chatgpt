# Challenge 4: Recipe Finder

Build a Recipe Finder App that helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have. Users should be able to enter ingredients they have at home, and the app will provide a list of recipes that can be made using those ingredients. You should integrate with a recipe API of your choice to fetch recipe data.

## Extra Points

- How would you implement a feature that allows users to filter recipes by dietary preferences, such as vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free?
- What strategies would you use to provide users with nutritional information for each recipe, including calories, protein, and other relevant details?
- Can you integrate a social sharing feature, enabling users to share their favorite recipes on popular social media platforms or via email?
