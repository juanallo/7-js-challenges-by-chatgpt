# Challenge 5: Weather App

Build a weather app that fetches weather data from a public API based on user input (e.g., city or zip code). Display the current weather and a 3-day forecast. Use JavaScript to make asynchronous API requests and render the data dynamically.

## Extra Points

- How would you enhance the user experience by incorporating geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and provide weather information without manual input?
- What additional weather data or features could you integrate, such as air quality index, UV index, or historical weather data for a selected location?
- Can you implement a feature that allows users to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Fahrenheit and Celsius) for temperature and wind speed, enhancing accessibility for users from various regions?
