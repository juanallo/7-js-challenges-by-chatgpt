# 7 JS Challenges By ChatGPT

Inspired by [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/) this repo contains 7 unique challenges that would help you continue practicing your frontend skills.

There is a twist, all the content was generated and written by chatGPT.

## Using the examples

Give it a try, each folder is a challenge that contains:
- A readme explaining the problem. There is also a Rubric to help you identify your weak spots.
- a starter.html file containing the starter code.
- a completed.html file showing one possible solution. There are multiple ways of doing the same. Feel free to pick your own adventure. 
 
If you create something cool I would love to see it. Catch me at [@juan_allo](https://twitter.com/juan_allo)

## Running the code

Drag and drop the HTML files directly into the browser. Each file is self contained so running and debugging is really simple. 

If you want to run a server instead you can follow this [guide](https://juanmanuelalloron.com/2020/05/21/tip-run-a-simple-server-with-python/)
